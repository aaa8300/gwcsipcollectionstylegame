## About

A fun and educational space-themed game where you control a catcher bin to intercept falling space debris before it reaches Earth. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your bin and catch trash to protect the planet!

## How It Works

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the catcher bin.
- Catch falling space trash to score points.
- Prevent space junk from reaching Earth â€” if too much escapes, you lose!
- Reach a certain score to win the mission.

## How I Made It

I created this game by modifying a base collection-style game during the **Girls Who Code 2025 Summer Immersion Program**. Using **p5.js** and the **p5play** library, I customized the visuals with space-themed assets like a starry background, trash images, and a space bin catcher. I built gameplay mechanics to track score, manage win and lose conditions, and designed an engaging start screen with mission instructions. This project involved working with sprites, handling keyboard input, and managing different game states in JavaScript.

## What I Learned & Challenges

This project helped me strengthen my skills in JavaScript game development, especially using the p5.js ecosystem. I learned how to:

- Work with sprites and animations using p5play.
- Handle user input to move game objects smoothly.
- Manage game states such as start screen, active gameplay, win, and lose conditions.
- Implement collision detection and score tracking.

One challenge I faced was properly positioning and updating text on different screens (start, win, lose) to ensure clarity and good user experience. Also, organizing the assets and making sure all files load correctly was a practical lesson in project structure and debugging.
